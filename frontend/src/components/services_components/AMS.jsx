                Every Client has different expectations on how they will support
                their Oracle Cloud Applications. Whether the goal is complete
                independence or outsourced Level 2-3 support, we know that
                Clients will need to have a support structure in place after go
                live to stabilize their implementation and mature their own team
                and governance structure. We know that the right approach for
                support will lead to faster stability, better user acceptance
                and ultimately satisfy client expectations as quickly as
                possible for their Cloud products.

                    With Cloud SaaS we now have a set of Applications that will
                    evolve quarterly with enhancements from Oracle in addition
                    to changes coming from new requirements as the business
                    evolves. We now have systems that will never go through a
                    “big bang” upgrade again, but we do have smaller changes
                    coming quite regularly. We know that one month may not look
                    like another month in terms of the resources required and we
                    know that the appetite for projects small and large may also
                    change at a Client. These dynamics call for flexible support
                    options with a close partnership to understand and adapt as
                    we evolve the product together.

                    Our goal with AMS is to have an experienced Manager of
                    Support assigned to every account. That leader must have
                    experience with the Oracle products and with the business
                    while working with his Client counterpart to maintain
                    service levels, organize changes, and manage the quarterly
                    updates. We don’t believe in coordinators—we want strong
                    liaisons who work with the business on priorities and
                    objectives whether short term or long term. This establishes
                    the foundation for the support partnership.

                    You will notice in our careers section that we are not
                    looking for junior resources. Whether onshore, near shore or
                    offshore, our staff includes resources who have many years
                    experience with Oracle Cloud products. This allows
                    individuals and teams at Automus to fix problems as quickly
                    as possible and it allows us to solution new ideas as
                    efficiently as possible.{" "}

                    By using experienced resources, we also suggest they don’t
                    always need to be full time. What we see every day is that
                    Cloud offers much faster stabilization than we realized
                    previously with on premise solutions, but clients also
                    embark on a much more fluid plan to enhance and add to the
                    product suite. We typically see a requirement for enhanced
                    support or HyperCare for the first few months after the go
                    live, followed by a steady decline in the need for resources
                    as we stabilize and the clients own resources grow
                    accustomed to their new applications. Once we have reached
                    that point or even while we are reaching that point, clients
                    are often adding additional capabilities related to natural
                    and planned changes to their business. This is the nature of
                    supporting Cloud as we see it.
