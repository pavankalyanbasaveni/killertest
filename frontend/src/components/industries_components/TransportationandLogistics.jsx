                    The key component to a logistics company is its ability to
                    manage its fleet of trucks/ships/planes. Leveraging Oracleâ€™s
                    Transportation Management solution OIAE can manage the
                    entire logistics network including route scheduling and
                    dispatch with integration into the ERP for building the
                    shipments in both full and LTL truck loads. Outside of core
                    transportation scheduling, OIAE has experience around
                    Maintenance of assets, and more industry unique requirements
                    around shipping documentation and storage to go with each
                    invoice.
