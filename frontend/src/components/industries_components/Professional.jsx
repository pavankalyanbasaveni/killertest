                Finding the right people with the right skills, and then
                leveraging that human capital through a project based
                environment to have predictable and quality results is a problem
                that makes professional services one of the most challenging.
                The gig economy has increased the complexity for Professional
                Services providers in managing their employee vs. contractor
                strategies.

                    OIAE excels in bringing the HCM and ERP components together
                    to drive value for our clients. Within HCM, recruiting and
                    retaining the right people for the correct compensation is
                    critical, as is understanding and planning for their
                    long-term career within the organization. With the right
                    people, you can now look at deploying them onto projects for
                    the company. As Finance people will know, having the proper
                    costing and billing engines are key to an efficient back
                    office, and this is challenging in professional services
                    organizations. How to track time and direct labor costs,
                    overtime, overhead costs, indirect costs, and how these are
                    costed and billed to clients can be confusing, especially as
                    clients increasingly desire contracts that are unique to
                    their requirements. OIAE can help bring the combination of
                    standardization and flexibility to this process and bring
                    all of these components from recruiting and compensation, to
                    time entry and billing and ensure these complex process
                    flows meet industry best practices and the unique
                    requirements of the business
