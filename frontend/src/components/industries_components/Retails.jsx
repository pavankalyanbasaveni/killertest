                As much or more than any other industry, Retail is going through
                a transformation driven by technology. The sharp increase in
                e-commerce, trends around employee retention and continued
                pressure on profit margin have made retail a challenging
                environment to be competitive in. Yet Retail companies that have
                navigated these challenges are as successful as ever, and often
                due to advantages in technology strategy.

                    Integration to Merchandising Solution: The core of a Retail
                    organization is their merchandising and POS systems. But

                    not properly integrated. OIAE brings a pre-architected
