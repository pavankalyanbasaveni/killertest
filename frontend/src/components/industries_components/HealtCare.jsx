                A once in a lifetime event like Covid19 can have dramatic
                effects on all industries, but especially the one directly tied
                to fighting the virus. Healthcare was already going through
                tremendous change with new treatments such as CAR-T and gene
                cell therapy, to tele-health approaches to appointments with a
                physician. Covid19 has put a strain on the healthcare system,
                and especially the employees. So how do Healthcare providers
                improve the experience for their patients, but also their
                internal staff to keep quality of care high?

                    How can Oracle and OIAE help the Healthcare industry?

                    Most Healthcare providers are looking for a unified ERP and
                    HCM platform to manage these functions effectively and in an
                    integrated manner. Within HCM, the recruitment and retention
                    of top talent has become more critical than ever. OIAE will
                    leverage industry best practices to help drive efficiencies
                    and effectiveness in recruiting, with the right tools to
                    ensure compensation is accurate based upon goals and
                    objectives of the organization. As it relates to ERP, supply
                    chain is typically most critical. How to ensure the hospital
                    has the right supplies in the right location to provide
                    effective care. PAR inventory is a unique requirement to
                    Healthcare, and this often then requires EDI to procure the
                    required items based upon PAR inventory counts. These
                    specialty requirements are areas which OIAE sets itself
                    apart to provide true value alongside the ERP/HCM
                    implementation to make our clients successful.{" "}
